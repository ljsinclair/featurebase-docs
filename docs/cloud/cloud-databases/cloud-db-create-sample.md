There are two methods to provision the sample database with an approximate duration of 10 minutes.

{% include /cloud-db/cloud-db-custom-note.md %}

{% include page-toc.md %}

## Before you begin
{: .no_toc }
{% include /cloud/cloud-before-begin.md %}

## Provision a billion record database

You can create the database in two ways.

### Method one - provision the database with an auto-generated name

{% include /cloud/homepage-db-create-options.md %} under **Start with a billion records**

### Method two - provision the database with a custom name

{% include /cloud-db/cloud-db-new-name.md %}
{% include /cloud-db/cloud-db-load-sample.md %}
{% include /cloud-db/cloud-db-click-create.md %}
