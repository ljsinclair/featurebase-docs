# Reference: FeatureBase system tables
{: .no_toc }

At a high-level, FeatureBase system tables:
* describe database configuration, settings and metrics
* are logical and in-memory tables, dynamically created on database creation

The only exception is `fb_views` which is automatically created when a user runs the [`CREATE VIEW` statement](/docs/sql-guide/statements/statement-view-create)
