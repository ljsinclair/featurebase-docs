# SQL ingest source reference
{: .no_toc}

FeatureBase can import data from MySQL, Postgres and MySQL databases using SQL queries executed at the command line.

{% include page-toc.md %}

## Before you begin

You will need the following privileges on the database:
* Database login credentials
* SELECT privileges on source tables
* Other privileges as required
* [Learn how to manage import](/docs/community/com-ingest/com-ingest-manage)

### Connect string (merge into the include file, below)

The SQL ingest tool connects to the source database using your login credentials before executing SQL queries.

{% include /com-ingest/com-ingest-flag-sql-connect-string.md%}

## Command-line SQL statements

Once connected to the source database, SQL queries copy data which is then batched, converted to Roaring Bitmap format then saved to a target FeatureBase index.
