## What kind of database is Roaring Bitmap Format?

At the highest level, RBF consists of two data files, saved to disk, also known as a **shard**.

![](/assets/images/concepts/concept-rbf-file-structure)

| Data file | Consisting of | Additional information |
|---|---|
| RBF | The RBF data file contains a sequential collection of Roaring Bitmap friendly 8kb page files | [RBF data file](#what-is-the-rbf-data-file) |
| Write Ahead Log (WAL) | Sequential snapshot of transactions batched into Roaring Bitmap containers of 2^16 integers (65536 bits) | When transactions finish, the checkpointing process:<br/>* updates each database page with changes from the WAL file<br/>* truncates the WAL file when updates are complete |

## What is the RBF data file?

Roaring Bitmap Format (RBF) is a collection of b-trees serialized to disk that contain a page heirarchy used to store:
* RBF metadata
* a b-tree structure that stores data in Roaring Bitmap containers.

### RBF metadata pages

The following page types contain RBF metadata:

| Page number | Page type | Description | Additional information |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Meta | The Meta page keeps track of b-tree information including:<br/>* total pages<br/>* current position in the Write Ahead Log<br/>* Root record page number<br/>* Freelist page number | * [Freelist page](#freelist-page)<br/>* [Meta page example](#meta-page) |
| 1 | Root record | Stores a list of bitmaps<br/>* defined as combination of field and view<br/>* and root page number for that b-tree | [Root record example](#root-record) |

### B-tree structure and data pages

The following page types contain the b-tree structure and data:

![](/assets/images/concepts/concept-rbf-page-tree.png)

| Page type | Description | Additional information |
|---|---|---|
| Branch | Branch pages make up the general “tree” structure of the b-tree, and consists of pointers to branch and leaf nodes | Pointers to additional branch pages are created when an RBF database is expanded. |
| Leaf | Leaf pages contain one or Roaring Bitmap containers of data in a specified format. | [Leaf page additional](#leaf-page-additional) |
| Bitmap | A bitmap page contains 8KB (65536 bytes) of Roaring Bitmap container data and is referenced by a Leaf Bitmap page. | [Bitmap page additional](#bitmap-page-additional) |

## Additional information

### Benefits and features of RBF

RBF has the following benefits and features:
* full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transaction support which allows incremental updates within the RBF file
* 8KB page files can accommodate the largest possible Roaring Bitmap container

### Freelist page

The Freelist page is an internal bitmap used to track deallocated pages.

#### How are pages deallocated?

A page is available for deallocation when:
* delete actions remove all elements from a page
* a bitmap is deleted

RBF deallocates pages to reduce disk space at the end of a transaction in three steps:
1. Deallocate free pages from the end of the data file
2. Adds deallocated pages to the Freelist
3. Shrinks the Meta page `pageN` field to remove the deallocated pages

{: .note}
RBF cannot deallocate pages that are in use.

#### How are pages reallocated?

RBF allocates a new page on disk:
* when a new bitmap is created
* if an existing page fills up and needs to be split in two

Page reallocation works on the following logic:

| Page available in Freelist | Page not available |
|---|---|
| Reallocate the lowest numbered page first | * Extend the Freelist data file<br/>* Add a new page<br/>* Increment the Meta page `pageN` field by 1 |

### Leaf page additional

Leaf pages relate directly to Roaring Bitmap format which:
* splits bitmaps into containers that are 65,536 bits wide
* chooses one of three encoding types for the container based on which will give the best compression:

| Type | Data storage | Use case | Additional information |
|---|---|---|---|
| Array | A Leaf Array page contains cells which correspond to a Roaring Bitmap container | Sparse containers with few bits set | An array of 16-bit integers is kept to tell which of the 65,535 bits are set |
| Run Length Encoded (RLE) | A Leaf RLE page contains cells which correspond to a Roaring Bitmap container | Containers where most or all bits are set |
| Bitmap pointer | Uncompressed, always 8KB (65,536 bits) |  | The cell contains a reference to a separate RBF page because Roaring Bitmap containers are exactly 8KB |

#### Leaf/Roaring Bitmap Bitwise operations

Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, DIFFERENCE, NOT, etc.) are defined on each possible pair of encodings which means:
* decode-operate-encode processes are not required
* all operations take place on the data in the format it's already in
* compression benefits double as performance benefits
* it takes fewer processor instructions to skip over sections of containers where no bits or all bits are set

### Bitmap page additional

Bitmaps are defined as a combination of field and view.

<!-- awaiting feedback on what these are
* Field=row
* View=
-->

{: .note}
Bitmap pages have no space for metadata so that is stored higher in the heirarchy
