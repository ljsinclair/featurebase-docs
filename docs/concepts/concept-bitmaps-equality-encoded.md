# How does FeatureBase encode non-integer values?
{: .no_toc }

FeatureBase uses **equality encoding** to create a Boolean relationship between a value and its unique identifier.

* [Learn about FeatureBase bitmaps](/docs/concepts/concept-bitmaps)

## What data types are equality-encoded?

Each value of user data mapped to the following data types are converted to equality-encoded bitmaps:

| User data | FeatureBase data type |
|---|---|
| Boolean | [BOOL](/docs/sql-guide/data-types/data-type-bool) |
| Unsigned integer | [ID](/docs/sql-guide/data-types/data-type-id) |
| Alphanumeric | [String](/docs/sql-guide/data-types/data-type-string) |
| Low cardinality | [`SET`, `SETQ`](/docs/sql-guide/data-types/data-types-home/#low-cardinality-data-types) |

## How does equality encoding work?

FeatureBase equality encoding:
* uses the actual value as a column name, saved to disk
* represents the relationship between unique identifier and column in boolean terms:
  * `1` indicates the relationship exists
  * `0` indicates it does not.

## How does FeatureBase equality encode data?

{% include /concepts/concept-bitmap-source-data-table.md %}

The `historical_name` data can be equality-encoded as follows:

```
| ID | Pilosa | Molecula | FeatureBase |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
```

```
| ID | Pilosa | Molecula | FeatureBase |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
```

```
| ID | Pilosa | Molecula | FeatureBase |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
```

## Equality encoding integer values

Equality encoding integer values is less effective because Boolean relationships are harder to represent.

### Equality encoding specific values

Using the `downloads` column as unique identifier, the data can be encoded as follows:
```
| id-downloads | Pilosa | Molecula | FeatureBase |
|---|---|
| 10000 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
```

```
| id-downloads | Pilosa | Molecula | FeatureBase |
|---|---|
| 18524 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
```

```
| id-downloads | Pilosa | Molecula | FeatureBase |
|---|---|
| 50000 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
```
### Encoding integer values as a range

Values can be encoded as a range which reduces the number of bitmaps and create/delete operations.

```
| id-download-range | Pilosa | Molecula | FeatureBase |
|---|---|---|
| 0-25000 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 25001-50000 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
```

### Issues equality encoding integer values

The following issues occur with equality encoding integers.

| Equality encoding method | Issue |
|---|---|
| Encode values | Two operations are required to update the values which incurs a processing overhead:<br/>* Create a new bitmap with updated values<br/>* Delete the original bitmap |
| Range encoding | Specific values are lost |

FeatureBase avoids these issues by bit-slicing integer values.
