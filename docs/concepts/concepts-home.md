# How does FeatureBase differ to a traditional database?

This high-level overview explains how data is arranged in traditional databases and FeatureBase bitmap databases.

* Cardinality -- the relationships between data
* Normalization -- the act of arranging the data to

## What is cardinality?

The relationships between data is called **Cardinality** and can be conceptualized as follows:

| Example | Data relationships | Cardinality | Dimensions to represent |
|---|---|---|---|
| A country and capital city | one-to-one | High | Two |
| A country and citizens | one-to-many | Low | Three or more |
| Citizens and government services | many-to-many | Low | Three or more |

### High cardinality data

High cardinality data has a high number of unique relationships which can be represented in a two dimensional table:

## Low cardinality data

Data described as **low cardinality** have multiple relationships which means they cannot be represented in two dimensions.



## Database normalization in relation to data cardinality

Database normalization has a set of **normal forms** which provide guidance on how data is represented.

The **first normal form** provides guidance on:
* arranging data into two dimensions
* the use of relation names, attributes and keys to reference rows

This set of rules means:
* High cardinality data requires no alteration (because there is no duplication and the relationships are one-to-one)
* Low cardinality data that has one-to-many or many-to-many relationships are:
  * inserted into separate two dimensional tables, and
  * relationships are maintained using keys

## Benefits and costs of data normalization

Data normalization is not a perfect solution to data cardinality:

| Benefit | Cost |
|---|---|
| Data integrity is easier to maintain | Data in separate tables makes indexing less efficient |
| Less duplication of data means faster inserts, updates and a smaller footprint | `JOIN` clauses are required to query data which makes queries more complex and therefore slower to return results |

DBAs responsible for normalized systems use different methods to overcome the issues and should the benefits outweigh the costs, may denormalize data.

## How does FeatureBase handle data cardinality?

FeatureBase does not use Database normalization. Instead, the system inserts data into a two-dimensional bitmap index.
