# FeatureBase Docs fork

This is a fork of documentation I wrote for the FeatureBase bitmap database. 

You can find documentation in the DOCS folder, but to get the full effect, you'll need to deploy a Jekyll instance.

I'm going to work on a way to get the docs up FYI.

## Deployment action

This deployment action was designed for the subdomain `docs.featurebase.com` but as featurebase.com is now gone, I need to get in and give it another try.

## Introduction

FeatureBase-docs is a Jekyll site deployed to GitHub Pages.

The site uses the *Just the Docs* gemfile theme which was set up based on the following instructions:

* [Just the docs gemfile theme](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md)

A gemfile theme:
* Automatically pulls the latest version of the theme when the site is built locally, deployed to staging or production
* Can be modified with local files (e.g., stylesheets, etc)
